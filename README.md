# Landing Page Project

**My first project during Egypt-FWD initive offered by ITIDA**

---

It's a Landing Page built with `HTML`, `CSS` & the powerful `JavaScript` â™¥

I've used `JavaScript` to make it more dynamic, here's how :\_

1.  Automaticaly create nav menu links based on how many section in the document
    - Using section `data` attribute to get the name of the section
    - Using section `id` attribute to help nav menu links to navigate to it
2.  Change active status for the section that's in window viewpoint smoothly for more focus & better UI/UX
3.  Highlight nav menu links based on active section ( scrollspy-like )
